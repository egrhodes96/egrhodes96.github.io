        <p>
          I teach middle and high school science through hands-on investigation, outdoor learning, and real-world context.
          My background spans international classrooms (Rome), experiential education, and marine research.

        I’ve been curious about the ocean for as long as I can remember. This childhood photo was taken during a school project where
        I said I wanted to be a marine biologist—years later, that curiosity became field research, molecular work, and a career teaching science.
